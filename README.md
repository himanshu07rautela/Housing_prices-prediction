# California Housing Prices - Linear Regression

This project uses the California Housing Prices dataset to predict house prices using a Linear Regression model.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information from the 1990 California census. It includes various features such as longitude, latitude, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, median house value, and ocean proximity.

## Project Steps

1. **Load and Explore the Dataset**
2. **Data Cleaning**
3. **Split the Data**
4. **Train the Model**
5. **Evaluate the Model**
6. **Feature Importance Visualization**

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
